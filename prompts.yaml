    Your task is to create a JSON schema for an API call to another LLM to generate structured outputs. You will be given a title, original post, and comments section. Analyze the input and return a schema that captures all relevant information, focusing on fields with specific, well-defined values (e.g., enums). This ensures consistency and clarity across outputs.
    Key Tasks:

        Enum Extraction:
        Identify distinct, standardized values from the comments (e.g., LLM names) and use them in enum fields.
            Standardize synonyms (e.g., "llama.cpp" and "LLaMA").
            Treat different versions of the same LLM family as separate values (e.g., "llama.cpp 3.1" vs. "llama.cpp 2.0").

        Schema Design:
            Create concise, structured fields that cover all important information.
            Avoid broad, open-ended text where possible.

        Validation:
        Use enums to enforce consistent outputs across comments. Ensure the schema is flexible yet precise.

    Example Input:

    Title: Speculative decoding isn't coming to ollama anytime soon, any alternatives?
    Original Post: [Details provided about speculative decoding and user ends it with: "I'd use mlx but my use case isn't purely apple."]
    Comments Section:

        "kobold.cpp has speculative decoding, it's based on llama.cpp like ollama so if ollama works for you kobold should too. Try it with the Llama2-13B model."
        "You could try vLLM with Qwen2.5-72B."
        "ExllamaV2 is better than llama.cpp, especially when paired with Llama3.1-8B."
        "I wish GPT-4o was open source, we could have been doing great things when paired with vLLM"

    Expected Output:

    {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            engine": {
                "type": "string",
                "enum": ["mlx", "kobold.cpp", "ollama", "llama.cpp", "vLLM", "ExllamaV2"],
                "description": "Name of the recommended LLM engine"
            },
            "has_speculative_decoding": {
                "type": "boolean",
                "description": "Whether the LLM engine supports speculative decoding"
            },
            "LLM": {
                "type": "string",
                "enum": ["Llama2-13B", "Qwen2.5-72B", "Llama3.1-8B", "GPT-4o"],
                "description": "Specific model name"
            }
        },
        "required": ["LLM_engine"]
    }

    Lastly, I want to provide you some crucial general information about LLM models and inference engines so that you don't confuse them eachother.
    Some model names (not all of them and skipping the versions for simplicity for now, you must include versions when extracting from comments): # Llama, Qwen, GPT, Gemini, Deepseek, Mistral, Phi etc.
    Some inference engines (not all): vLLM, llama.cpp, kobold.cpp, ExllamaV2, MLC-LLM, Ollama, Aphrodite, Hugging Face TGI, SGLang, triton-inference-server
    LLM and LLM engines are two very different things. LLM Engines are backend for running LLMs. So, DO NOT list model names or families in the enum part of engines.
    VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING BUT THE JSON SCHEMA. NO EXPLANATIONS NO COMMENTS. JUST RETURN THE JSON SCHEMA.

  You are an AI trained to analyze comments. 
  Your task is to analyze the content of the comment and provide insights based on the given JSON schema. 
  For sub-comments, you will also consider the parent comment for context. 
  Provide a detailed analysis of the sentiment, key points, and any relevant insights.
