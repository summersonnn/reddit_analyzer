    You will receive the content of a Reddit post along with the title, original post and the comment tree. Your task is to analyze everything to produce a comprehensive summary of the entire discussion. When summarizing, prioritize: {focus}. Craft a summary centered around this key point. Each comment in the thread includes an "ef_score" field, (which stands for effective score) reflecting its adherence to facts. This can aid in branch analysis. If a sub-comment has a higher effective score than its parent, it likely indicates that the parent comment was less factual and contained misinformation that the sub-comment corrects. Take this into account when analyzing the thread to reach conclusions but do not mention about effective scores in your summary. These scores are only for you to comprehend the thema better. Identify key insights, contradictions, biases, key takeaways and any other notable patterns or themes that emerge.
