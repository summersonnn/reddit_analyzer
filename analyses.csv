The discussion on Reddit's r/LaMA community revolves around the release of new image models and whether they will surpass existing ones like Flux and SD3.1.

*   **StableLlama**: The author suggests that Flux can be trained well, citing its large number of LoRAs (Large Robust Models). They also mention the success of great quality finetunes.
*   **Far_Insurance4191**: They think the main issue with current image models is that both Flux and SD3.5 haven't been easy to train due to their gimped capabilities. However, they expect the development of an Auraflow tune, which might see improvement in 2025.
*   **Still_Ad_4928**: The author expects the release of Janus 7b-pro by Deepseek as a trend in image models, possibly including Llama-4 with omni capabilities.
*   **GortKlaatu_**: They mention that SD3 has a bad license and express their disappointment. However, they also mention the existence of PixArt and Flux with finetunes and Lora's.
*   **MrDevGuyMcCoder**: This author mentions PixArt as a potential image model in addition to Flux.
*   **Deepesh42896**: They indicate that there is one named ""WanX 2.1"" coming soon, which seems to be an open weights model from the qwen team.

**Key Findings**

The discussion highlights various aspects of current and upcoming image models:

*   The development of new models continues, with improvements in training capabilities and finetune quality.
*   Uncensored NSFW fine-tunes are gaining attention due to their basic simplicity once described in detail.
*   Llama-4 has the potential for omni capabilities, making it a strong contender.

**Notable Trends or Themes**

The discussion emphasizes the following trends:

*   The importance of training and finetune quality in image models.
*   The potential of open weights models from external developers (PixArt).
*   The impact of bad licenses on image model development.

**Implicit Biases and Counterarguments**

Some implicit biases can be seen, such as:

*   The discussion might be biased towards optimistic expectations about new image models.
*   Llama-4's omni capabilities may not necessarily address all the challenges associated with current models.

However, counterarguments can also be identified, for example, the possibility of PixArt improving upon existing models or the potential drawbacks of open weights models.",nan,"[[[{""author"": ""Still_Ad_4928"", ""score"": 6, ""ef_score"": 6, ""body"": ""Expecting Janus 7b-pro by Deepseek \""a first open source attempt at omni capabilities\"" to become a trend in future releases - maybe including Llama-4 as per Zuckerberg's words.
